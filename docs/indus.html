        <p>
            The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, is one of the world’s earliest urban cultures, flourishing between 2500 BCE and 1500 BCE in what is now India and Pakistan. Beyond its remarkable achievements in city planning, trade, and architecture, the Indus Valley Civilization also left behind a rich legacy of art and craftsmanship. The art of this ancient civilization reveals not only their creativity but also their social structure, beliefs, and connection with nature.
            The people of the Indus Valley were skilled artisans who worked with a wide range of materials such as clay, stone, bronze, and terracotta. Their art was not created for mere decoration — it served religious, symbolic, and practical purposes. Among the most iconic discoveries of Indus art are the terracotta figurines, stone sculptures, seals, and pottery found at sites like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira.
            One of the most famous examples of Indus Valley art is the Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-Daro, a small bronze statue just 10.5 cm tall. Despite its size, the figure conveys remarkable energy and confidence — the girl stands with one hand on her hip, her bangles covering almost her entire arm, and her posture full of life. This sculpture reflects not only technical mastery in bronze casting but also an appreciation of movement and human emotion.
            Another notable artifact is the Priest-King statue, a steatite sculpture believed to represent a figure of authority or spirituality. The detailed beard, patterned robe, and calm expression show a refined sense of realism and dignity. Such artworks suggest that the people of the Indus Valley had a well-developed sense of aesthetics and possibly practiced organized religious rituals.
            The seals of the Indus Valley are perhaps the most fascinating form of art from the civilization. Made of steatite, these seals were engraved with animal figures, human motifs, and the mysterious Indus script — which remains undeciphered to this day. The recurring symbols of bulls, elephants, tigers, and unicorn-like creatures hint at cultural and possibly religious significance. These seals were likely used for trade, identification, or spiritual protection, showing how art and commerce were closely linked.
            Pottery was another important artistic form. The Indus people produced beautifully shaped and decorated pottery, often painted with geometric designs, birds, and animal motifs. The symmetry and precision of these patterns reveal the technical skill and aesthetic sensibility of the artisans. Terracotta toys, carts, and animal figures also show that art was part of everyday life, not limited to ritual or decoration.
            Indus Valley art stands out for its simplicity, balance, and naturalism. Unlike later Indian art forms that focused on grandeur and ornamentation, Harappan art was practical yet expressive. Every artifact — from a seal to a sculpture — reflects a civilization that valued craftsmanship, symbolism, and order.
            In conclusion, the art of the Indus Valley Civilization offers a window into one of the world’s oldest and most advanced societies. It shows us that even thousands of years ago, humans sought beauty, expression, and meaning in their creations. The legacy of Indus art reminds us that creativity and culture have always been at the heart of civilization — a truth that continues to define humanity to this day.
